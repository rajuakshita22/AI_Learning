    "The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.\n",
    "However, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.\n",
